1) A hard drive has the following properties: Rotational rate = 10,000 RPM, Average seek time = 4ms., Avg # sectors/track = 800, 1024 Bytes/sector. Find the total access time to read 32KB of data (1KB = 1024 Bytes) from one surface of a hard drive.

Work:
Average rotational delay: 10,000R PM = 166.67 rev/sec or 6 ms/rev. Avg rot delay = 3 ms/rev
Sector read time: disk is at 6 ms/rev, 800 sectors per track, 6/800 ms = 0.0075 ms.
Disk Access Time = Seek Time (4 ms) + Average Rotational Delay (3 ms) + Sector Read Time (0.0075ms) + Overhead (assuming 0 since not given) = 

ANS: 7.0075ms


2) Compare 70% cache hit rate with 31% cache miss rate, if the latency for a miss is 10x and 100x worse for a hit.

3) Fortrarn programming language uses column major ordering to store arrays. If I have a large 2D array in Fortran with individual dimensions of array exceeding the cache memory size, what would be the cache miss rate when traversing along a column and when traversing along a row?
