One obvious way to transpose a matrix is to use,
	for i=0:n-1
		for j=0:n-1
			destination(j+i*n) = source(i+j*n)
		end
	end
How can you take advantage of locality and cache blocking to improve the performance of this operation?

Use cache blocking to perform the operations on multiple source locations.
